# Generate Improvement Ideas

Use the current date from session context when dating ideation documents and checking recent ideation artifacts.

## When to Use

- Asking what to improve or requesting idea generation
- Exploring surprising improvements or proactive project directions
- Before brainstorming — identifies **which** ideas are worth exploring in depth

**When NOT to use:** When the user already has a specific feature idea (use **brainstorming** instead).

`ideating` precedes `brainstorming`.

- `ideating` answers: "What are the strongest ideas worth exploring?"
- `brainstorming` answers: "What exactly should one chosen idea mean?"
- `writing-arch-plans` answers: "How should it be built?"

This workflow produces a ranked ideation artifact in `docs/ideation/`. It does **not** produce requirements, plans, or code.

## Interaction Method

Use **`AskQuestion`** as the primary blocking question tool when choosing direction.

Ask one question at a time. Prefer concise single-select choices when natural options exist.

## Focus Hint

#$ARGUMENTS

Interpret any provided argument as optional context. It may be:

- a concept such as `DX improvements`
- a path such as `.cursor/skills/compound-engineering/`
- a constraint such as `low-complexity quick wins`
- a volume hint such as `top 3`, `100 ideas`, or `raise the bar`

If no argument is provided, proceed with open-ended ideation.

## Core Principles

1. **Ground before ideating** - Scan the actual codebase first. Do not generate abstract product advice detached from the repository.
2. **Generate many -> critique all -> explain survivors only** - The quality mechanism is explicit rejection with reasons, not optimistic ranking. Do not let extra process obscure this pattern.
3. **Route action into brainstorming** - Ideation identifies promising directions; `brainstorming` defines the selected one precisely enough for planning. Do not skip to planning from ideation output.

## Execution Flow

Create TodoWrite todos from this workflow:

```
TodoWrite todos:
  - id: "ideate-0", content: "Phase 0: Resume and scope", status: "pending"
  - id: "ideate-1", content: "Phase 1: Codebase scan", status: "pending"
  - id: "ideate-2", content: "Phase 2: Divergent ideation", status: "pending"
```

### Phase 0: Resume and Scope

#### 0.1 Check for Recent Ideation Work

Look in `docs/ideation/` for ideation documents created within the last 30 days.

Treat a prior ideation doc as relevant when:

- the topic matches the requested focus
- the path or subsystem overlaps the requested focus
- the request is open-ended and there is an obvious recent open ideation doc
- the issue-grounded status matches: do not offer to resume a non-issue ideation when the current argument indicates issue-tracker intent, or vice versa — treat these as distinct topics

If a relevant doc exists, ask whether to:

1. continue from it
2. start fresh

If continuing:

- read the document
- summarize what has already been explored
- preserve previous idea statuses and session log entries
- update the existing file instead of creating a duplicate

#### 0.2 Interpret Focus and Volume

Infer three things from the argument:

- **Focus context** - concept, path, constraint, or open-ended
- **Volume override** - any hint that changes candidate or survivor counts
- **Issue-tracker intent** - whether the user wants issue/bug data as an input source

Issue-tracker intent triggers when the argument's primary intent is about analyzing issue patterns: `bugs`, `github issues`, `open issues`, `issue patterns`, `what users are reporting`, `bug reports`, `issue themes`.

Do NOT trigger on arguments that merely mention bugs as a focus: `bug in auth`, `fix the login issue`, `the signup bug` — these are focus hints, not requests to analyze the issue tracker.

When combined (e.g., `top 3 bugs in authentication`): detect issue-tracker intent first, volume override second, remainder is the focus hint. The focus narrows which issues matter; the volume override controls survivor count.

Default volume:

- each ideation sub-agent generates about 8-10 ideas (yielding ~30 raw ideas across agents, ~20-25 after dedupe)
- keep the top 5-7 survivors

Honor clear overrides such as:

- `top 3`
- `100 ideas`
- `go deep`
- `raise the bar`

Use reasonable interpretation rather than formal parsing.

### Phase 1: Codebase Scan

Before generating ideas, gather codebase context.

Run agents in parallel in the **foreground** (do not use background dispatch — the results are needed before proceeding):

1. **Quick context scan** — dispatch a general-purpose sub-agent using `model: "fast"` with this prompt:

> Read the project's AGENTS.md (or README.md if not present), then discover the top-level directory layout using `Glob` with pattern `*` or `*/*`. Return a concise summary (under 30 lines) covering:
>
> - project shape (language, framework, top-level directory layout)
> - notable patterns or conventions
> - obvious pain points or gaps
> - likely leverage points for improvement
>
> Keep the scan shallow — read only top-level documentation and directory structure. Do not analyze GitHub issues, templates, or contribution guidelines. Do not do deep code search.
>
> Focus hint: {focus_hint}

2. **Learnings search** — dispatch `learnings-researcher` (`.cursor/agents/learnings-researcher.md`) with a brief summary of the ideation focus.

3. **Issue intelligence** (conditional) — if issue-tracker intent was detected in Phase 0.2, dispatch `issue-intelligence-analyst` (`.cursor/agents/issue-intelligence-analyst.md`) with the focus hint. If a focus hint is present, pass it so the agent can weight its clustering toward that area. Run this in parallel with agents 1 and 2.

If the agent returns an error (gh not installed, no remote, auth failure), log a warning to the user ("Issue analysis unavailable: {reason}. Proceeding with standard ideation.") and continue with the existing two-agent grounding.

If the agent reports fewer than 5 total issues, note "Insufficient issue signal for theme analysis" and proceed with default ideation frames in Phase 2.

Consolidate all results into a short grounding summary. When issue intelligence is present, keep it as a distinct section so ideation sub-agents can distinguish between code-observed and user-reported signals:

- **Codebase context** — project shape, notable patterns, obvious pain points, likely leverage points
- **Past learnings** — relevant institutional knowledge from docs/solutions/
- **Issue intelligence** (when present) — theme summaries from the issue intelligence agent, preserving theme titles, descriptions, issue counts, and trend directions

**Feishu context** (opt-in) — never auto-dispatch. Route by condition:

- **Tools available + user asked**: Dispatch `feishu-researcher` (`.cursor/agents/feishu-researcher.md`) with the focus hint in parallel with other Phase 1 agents. Include findings in the grounding summary.
- **Tools available + user didn't ask**: Note in output: "Feishu tools detected. Ask me to search Feishu for organizational context at any point, or include it in your next prompt."
- **No tools + user asked**: Note in output: "Feishu context was requested but no Feishu tools are available. Install and authenticate the Feishu (Lark) plugin to enable organizational context search."

Do **not** do external research in v1.

### Phase 2: Divergent Ideation

Generate the full candidate list before critiquing any idea.

Dispatch 3-4 parallel ideation sub-agents on the inherited model (do not tier down -- creative ideation needs the orchestrator's reasoning level). Omit the `mode` parameter so the user's configured permission settings apply. Each targets ~8-10 ideas (yielding ~30 raw ideas, ~20-25 after dedupe). Adjust per-agent targets when volume overrides apply (e.g., "100 ideas" raises it, "top 3" may lower the survivor count instead).

Give each sub-agent: the grounding summary, the focus hint, the per-agent volume target, and an instruction to generate raw candidates only (not critique). Each agent's first few ideas tend to be obvious -- push past them. Ground every idea in the Phase 1 scan.

Assign each sub-agent a different ideation frame as a **starting bias, not a constraint**. Prompt each to begin from its assigned perspective but follow any promising thread -- cross-cutting ideas that span multiple frames are valuable.

**Frame selection:**

- **When issue-tracker intent is active and themes were returned:** Each high/medium-confidence theme becomes a frame. Pad with default frames if fewer than 3 cluster-derived frames. Cap at 4 total.
- **Default frames (no issue-tracker intent):** (1) user/operator pain and friction, (2) inversion, removal, or automation of a painful step, (3) assumption-breaking or reframing, (4) leverage and compounding effects.

Ask each sub-agent to return a compact structure per idea: title, summary, why_it_matters, evidence/grounding hooks, optional boldness or focus_fit signal.

After all sub-agents return:

1. Merge and dedupe into one master candidate list.
2. Synthesize cross-cutting combinations -- scan for ideas from different frames that combine into something stronger (expect 3-5 additions at most).
3. If a focus was provided, weight the merged list toward it without excluding stronger adjacent ideas.
4. Spread ideas across multiple dimensions when justified: workflow/DX, reliability, extensibility, missing capabilities, docs/knowledge compounding, quality/maintenance, leverage on future work.

After merging and synthesis, read [post-ideation-workflow.md](./references/post-ideation-workflow.md) for the adversarial filtering rubric, presentation format, artifact template, handoff options, and quality bar. Do not load this file before Phase 2 agent dispatch completes.
