# Document Review Output Template

Use this **exact format** when presenting synthesized review findings. Findings are grouped by severity, not by reviewer.

**IMPORTANT:** Use pipe-delimited markdown tables (`| col | col |`). Do NOT use ASCII box-drawing characters.

## Document Review Results

**Document:** docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feat-user-auth-plan.md
**Type:** plan
**Reviewers:** coherence, feasibility, security-lens, scope-guardian

- security-lens -- plan adds public API endpoint with auth flow
- scope-guardian -- plan has 15 requirements across 3 priority levels

Applied 5 auto-fixes. 4 findings to consider (2 errors, 2 omissions).

### Auto-fixes Applied

- Standardized "pipeline"/"workflow" terminology to "pipeline" throughout (coherence)
- Fixed cross-reference: Section 4 referenced "Section 3.2" which is actually "Section 3.1" (coherence)
- Updated unit count from "6 units" to "7 units" to match listed units (coherence)
- Added "update API rate-limit config" step to Unit 4 -- implied by Unit 3's rate-limit introduction (feasibility)
- Added auth token refresh to test scenarios -- required by Unit 2's token expiry handling (security-lens)

## Section Rules

- **Summary line**: Always present after the reviewer list. Format: "Applied N auto-fixes. K findings to consider (X errors, Y omissions)." Omit any zero clause.
- **Auto-fixes Applied**: List all fixes that were applied automatically (auto class). Include enough detail per fix to convey the substance -- especially for fixes that add content or touch document meaning. Omit section if none.
- **P0-P3 sections**: Only include sections that have findings. Omit empty severity levels. Within each severity, separate into **Errors** and **Omissions** sub-headers. Omit a sub-header if that severity has none of that type.
- **Residual Concerns**: Findings below confidence threshold that were promoted by cross-persona corroboration, plus unpromoted residual risks. Omit if none.
- **Deferred Questions**: Questions for later workflow stages. Omit if none.
- **Coverage**: Always include. All counts are **post-synthesis**. **Findings** must equal Auto + Present exactly -- if deduplication merged a finding across personas, attribute it to the persona with the highest confidence and reduce the other persona's count. **Residual** = count of `residual_risks` from this persona's raw output (not the promoted subset in the Residual Concerns section).
